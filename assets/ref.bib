 abstract={Circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars have for a long time been modelled assuming a spherical symmetry. However, recent observations of the inner winds of these stars have shown that they exhibit a variety of complex structures, such as spirals, equatorial density enhancements, disks, bipolar outflows, etc. These structures are believed to originate from the presence of a companion, either stellar and/or planetary. Due to the inherently three-dimensional (3D) nature of this phenomenon, its investigation requires advanced 3D-simulations. It has already been shown that using hydrodynamic simulations, some of these wind morphologies can be obtained. However, the computational cost of truly selfconsistent calculations, including the crucial chemical and radiation processes, is currently still computationally prohibitive. Therefore, incremental modelling improvements using ever more refined approximations can significantly advance the quality and physical consistency of the simulations. One such problem revolves around the transfer of momentum from the stellar photons to the dust particles in the AGB wind. Until recently, this coupling has always either been ignored, or treated in the optically thin limit, which only requires knowledge on the local quantities. However, properly accounting for the dust opacity and its attenuation of the stellar radiation field can drastically affect the effective radiation pressure on the dust. In turn, this can significantly alter the dynamics and morphology of these stellar winds.

 In the context of a large collaboration that revolves around upgrading the treatment of dusty winds within the smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics code PHANTOM, I have worked on levelling up the way in which dust acceleration is calculated. To calculate the attenuation of the stellar radiation field, knowledge on the distribution and optical properties of the matter in-between each particle and the star is required. To this end the ray-tracing algorithm of the radiative transfer code MAGRITTE was extracted, made compatible with the SPH philosophy, and coupled to PHANTOM. We investigated different options to speed up the ray-tracer with only a minimal loss in accuracy. We show that the best results are found when rays are traced outwards from the star in a uniform distribution, set by HEALPix. Because not all particles are struck by a ray, we also investigated different interpolation approaches. We find that interpolation scaling with the inverse square of the perpendicular distance to the four closest rays gives the most desirable result. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our new approach in a simulation.}

  abstract = {The cool and dusty circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) have for a long time been modelled assuming a spherical symmetry. High spatial resolution observations of these stars have shown that their surroundings exhibit a variety of complex structures. Most of these structures are believed to originate from the interaction of the AGB wind with an obfuscated, nearby, orbiting stellar or planetary companion. Due to the inherent three-dimensional nature of these structures, a detailed understanding of these objects and the dominant wind-shaping mechanisms can therefore only be obtained from advanced three-dimensional treatments. Hydrodynamics simulations (with both particle- and grid-based codes) in the literature show that some of the observed morphologies can indeed be reproduced. However, due to the large computational cost a lot of critical physics has been strongly simplified, or even omitted. It is in this context that we present our work on upgrading the way in which attenuation of the stellar radiation field affects the effective radiation pressure on the dust by abandoning the widely adopted optically thin limit in calculating the dust acceleration. In this talk I will present my master thesis project where I coupled a ray-tracer with the smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics code Phantom to calculate the dust acceleration everywhere in the wind, and how to make it feasible for on-the-fly calculations. I will present the implications of this new treatment on the dynamics and morphology of the AGB outflows by means of three-dimensional AGB binary simulations.}

  abstract = {About 95% of all stars in the galaxy have an initial mass lower than 8 solar masses. When these stars evolve off the Main Sequence, they will go through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, just before turning into a White Dwarf (WD). This evolutionary phase is characterized by significant mass loss, large stellar radii, strong pulsations, and extreme luminosities. It must be studied to get a complete picture of the evolution of planetary systems from the birth to the end of their host stars. Indeed, population synthesis studies indicate that the majority of these stars have at least one (sub)stellar companion, where the abrupt changes in stellar characteristics may completely transform a planetary/binary system. In order to establish whether the planetary/(sub)stellar companion survives this evolutionary phase, and explain the presence of planets orbiting around WDs, one must study their orbital evolution for which both the stellar mass loss rate and mass accretion efficiency onto the companion and tidal interactions between the star and its companion play an important role. In current literature this is only addressed taking into account the simplest equilibrium tide, with mass-loss rate prescriptions and mass accretion efficiencies now considered outdated. For this reason, the treatment of these processes needs to be improved. First, we now study the dynamical tide, which can exceed the dissipation of the equilibrium tide by 3 orders of magnitude, which needs to be studied all along the evolution of stars. Second, we compute complex 3D hydrodynamic simulations that take into account all the complex components of the wind launching mechanism, as well as the gravitational perturbation of the companion. This makes it possible to account for the companion in simulating the mass loss rates, model for wind Roche Lobe overflow determining the mass accretion efficiency on the companion, as well as simulate the morphological structure of the AGB surroundings created by the companion. This allows us to build step by step coherent models of planetary systems orbiting evolved AGB stars.}
