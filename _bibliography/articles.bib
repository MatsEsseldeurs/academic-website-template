     abstract = {Solar-like stars evolve through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. This phase is characterized by increased radii, high luminosities, and significant mass loss. In order to understand the survival of companions during this phase, and explain the presence of planets orbiting white dwarfs, it is essential to examine the orbital evolution of these systems. Several physical mechanisms come into play for AGB stars, such as stellar mass-loss and tidal interactions between the star and its companion. On the one hand, evaluating mass-loss rates and accretion to the companion requires complex radiation-hydro-chemical simulations. On the other hand, the full history of tidal dissipation in low-mass stars during their late stages of evolution, which strongly depends on internal structure and boundary conditions, still requires dedicated studies. Finally a simultaneous treatment of winds and tides is required to predict a planet’s orbital evolution.},

     abstract = {<b>Context.</b> Stars with an initial mass below ∼ 8 M⊙ will evolve through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, during which they develop a strong stellar wind, due to radiation pressure on newly formed dust grains. Recent observations have revealed significant morphological complexities in AGB outflows, which are most probably caused by the interaction with a companion.
<b>Aims.</b> We aim for a more accurate description of AGB wind morphologies by accounting for both the radiation force in dust-driven winds and the impact of a companion on the AGB wind morphology.
<b>Methods.</b> We present the implementation of a ray-tracer for radiative transfer in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom. Our method allows for the creation of a 3D map of the optical depth around the AGB star. The effects of 4 different descriptions of radiative transfer, with different degrees of complexity, are compared: the free-wind approximation, the geometrical approximation, the Lucy approximation, and the attenuation approximation. Finally, we compare the Lucy and attenuation approximation to predictions with the 3D radiative transfer code Magritte.
<b>Results.</b> The effects of the different radiative transfer treatments are analysed considering both a low and high mass-loss rate regime and this both in the case of a single AGB star, as well as for an AGB binary system. For both low and high mass-loss rates, the velocity profile of the outflow is modified when going from the free-wind to the geometrical approximation, also resulting in a different wind morphology for AGB binary systems. In the case of a low mass-loss rate, the effect of the Lucy and attenuation approximation is negligible due to the low densities but morphological differences appear in the high mass-loss rate regime. By comparing the radiative equilibrium temperature and radiation force to the predictions from Magritte, we show that for most of the model the Lucy approximation works best, although close to the companion artificial heating occurs; and that it fails to simulate the shadow cast by the companion. The attenuation approximation leads to a stronger absorption of the radiation field yielding lower equilibrium temperature, weaker radiation force but produces the shadow cast by the companion. From the predictions of the 3D radiative transfer code Magritte, we also conclude that a radially directed radiation force is a reasonable assumption.
<b>Conclusions.</b> The radiation force plays a critical role in dust-driven AGB winds, impacting the velocity profile and morphological structures. For low mass-loss rates, the geometrical approximation suffices, but for high mass-loss rates a more rigorous method is required. Among the studied approaches, the Lucy approximation provides the most accurate results, although it does not account for all effects.},

     abstract = {Low- and intermediate mass stars experience a significant mass loss during the last phases of their evolution, which obscures them in a vast, dusty envelope. Although it has long been thought this envelope is generally spherically symmetric in shape, recent high-resolution observations find that most of these stars exhibit complex and asymmetrical morphologies, most likely resulting from binary interaction. In order to improve our understanding about these systems, theoretical studies are needed in the form of numerical simulations. Currently, a handful of simulations exist, albeit they mainly focus on the hydrodynamics of the outflow. Hence, we here present the pathway to more detailed and accurate modelling of companion-perturbed outflows with, by discussing the missing but crucial physical and chemical processes. With these state-of-the-art simulations we aim to make a direct comparison with observations to unveil the true identity on the embedded systems.}

     abstract = {<b>Context.</b> As the observed occurrence for planets or stellar companions orbiting low- and intermediate-mass evolved stars is increasing, so is the importance of understanding and evaluating the strength of their interactions. This is important for the further evolution of both our own Earth-Sun system and most of the observed exoplanetary systems. One of the most fundamental mechanisms behind this interaction is the tidal dissipation in these stars, as it is one of the engines of the orbital and rotational evolution of star-planet and star-star systems.
<b>Aims.</b> This article builds upon previous works that studied the evolution of the tidal dissipation along the pre-main sequence and the main sequence of low- and intermediate-mass stars and found a strong link between the structural and rotational evolution of stars and tidal dissipation. This article provides, for the first time, a complete picture of tidal dissipation along the entire evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars, including the advanced phases of evolution.
<b>Methods.</b> Using stellar evolutionary models, the internal structure of the star was computed from the pre-main sequence all the way up to the white dwarf phase for stars with initial masses between 1 and 4 Msun. Using this internal structure, the tidal dissipation was computed along the entire stellar evolution. Tidal dissipation was separated into two components: the dissipation of the equilibrium (non-wave-like) tide and the dissipation of the dynamical (wave-like) tide. For evolved stars, the dynamical tide is constituted by progressive internal gravity waves. The evolution of the tidal dissipation was investigated for both the equilibrium and dynamical tides, and the results were compared.
<b>Results.</b> The significance of both the equilibrium and dynamical tide dissipation becomes apparent within distinct domains of the parameter space. The dissipation of the equilibrium tide is dominant when the star is large or the companion is far from the star. Conversely, the dissipation of the dynamical tide is important when the star is small or the companion is close to the star. The size and location of these domains depend on the masses of both the star and the companion, as well as on the evolutionary phase.
<b>Conclusions.</b> Both the equilibrium and the dynamical tides are important in evolved stars, and therefore both need to be taken into account when studying the tidal dissipation in evolved stars and the evolution of the planetary and/or stellar companions orbiting them.},
