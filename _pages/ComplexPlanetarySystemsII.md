About 95% of all stars in the galaxy have an initial mass lower than 8 solar masses. When these stars evolve off the Main Sequence, they will go through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, just before turning into a White Dwarf (WD). This phase is characterized by increased radii, high luminosities, intense pulsations, and significant mass loss. In order to get a complete picture of the evolution of planetary systems from the birth to the end of their host stars, as well as to comprehend the survival of planetary or stellar companions during this phase and explain the presence of planets orbiting white dwarfs, it is essential to examine the orbital evolution of these systems. Several factors come into play for studying orbital evolution around AGB stars, such as the significant stellar mass-loss rate, the efficiency of mass accretion onto the companion, and the tidal interactions between the star and its companion.

<h4>3D simulations of AGB stellar winds</h4>

AGB stars lose a significant amount of mass through the so-called dust-driven wind. Pulsations at the surface of AGB stars push material into sufficiently high layers where it is cool enough for molecules to condensate into dust. These dust particles are opague, such that they can be pushed outward by radiation pressure. Finally the dust particles collide with the remaining gas particles and create a steady outflow of material. These outflows from AGB stars exhibit complex structures, such as arcs, spirals. The current theory suggests that these complexities are caused by an unseen companion. To understand this phenomenon, complex 3D hydrochemical simulations are necessary to understand the influence a companion can have on the morphological structures of AGB outlows. These simulations also allow us to investigate the impact of the companion on the star's mass loss rate and the efficiency of accretion onto the companion. However, the existing simulations are computationally demanding, and ongoing efforts are concentrated on enhancing the computational speed.

<h4>Tidal dissipation around evolved stars</h4>

Tidal dissipation encompasses two components: equilibrium and dynamical tides. The former occurs due to the gravitational pull of the companion, causing a deformation of the star. Viscosity creates a tidal lag which facilitates transfer of angular momentum. The latter involves secondary effects, such as pulsations, which are influenced by the star’s internal structure. AGB stars possess a convective envelope exciting inertial modes and a radiative core exciting gravity waves in response to tides. The dissipation of these waves varies depending on the boundary conditions. While for main-sequence stars static boundary conditions are adequate, the substantial mass loss of AGB stars necessitates the exploration of more suitable boundary conditions.

<h4>The connection between tides and mass loss</h4>
AGB winds are driven by pulsations, and tides may induce pulsations. Hence tides can result in an increased mass-loss rate. Mass loss modifies the tidal dissipation boundary conditions. Hence, mass-loss may induce additional dissipation.

In order to investigate the orbital evolution of companions around AGB stars, both mass loss and tidal dissipation play crucial roles. Complex simulations are essential for understanding how companions impact a star's mass loss rate, and the efficiency of accretion onto the companion. Tidal dissipation, which relies on internal structure and boundary conditions, requires further exploration regarding mass loss. The interplay between winds, pulsations, and tides signifies a mutual influence between mass loss and tidal dissipation, presenting a complex problem that demands further investigation.
