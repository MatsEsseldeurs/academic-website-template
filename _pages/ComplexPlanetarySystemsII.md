During the evolution of stars like our sun, they undergo the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
phase before becoming white dwarfs. This phase is marked by increased radii, high
luminosities, intense pulsations, and substantial mass loss. To understand the survival of
planetary or stellar companions during this phase and explain the presence of planets orbiting
white dwarfs, the orbital evolution of these systems needs to be examined. Several factors
come into play for AGB stars, including the stellar mass loss rate, the efficiency of mass
accretion onto the companion, and tidal interactions between the star and its companion.

<h4>3D simulations of AGB stellar winds</h4>

AGB stars experience mass loss via a
dust-driven wind caused by strong
pulsations and radiation pressure on
newly formed dust grains. Their
outflows display complex shapes,
caused to a hidden companion. To
understand this phenomenon, we
require complex 3D hydro-chemical
simulations. These simulations enable
us to explore how the companion
affects the star's mass loss rate and
the accretion efficiency onto the
companion. However, the current
simulations are computationally
intensive, so ongoing efforts are
focused on accelerating the speed of these simulations.

<h4>Tidal dissipation around evolved stars</h4>

Tidal dissipation consists of equilibrium tide and dynamical tide. The former
results from hydrodynamic deformation of the star due to the companion's gravity,
with friction and viscosity causing a tidal lag and angular momentum transfer. The
latter involves secondary effects like pulsations, dependent on the star's internal
structure. AGB stars possess a convective envelope, exciting inertial modes, and
a radiative core, exciting gravity waves due to tides. Dissipation and amplitudes of
these modes vary based on boundary conditions. While main sequence stars
typically use static boundary conditions, the substantial mass loss in AGB stars
requires exploring more suitable boundary conditions.

<h4>The connection between tides and mass loss</h4>
AGB winds are driven by pulsations,
and tides create pulsations, thus
tides can induce additional mass loss.
Mass loss modify tidal dissipation
boundary conditions, thus mass loss
can induce additional dissipation.

To study the orbital evolution of companions around AGB stars, both mass loss and tidal
dissipation are important. Complex simulations are necessary to understand how companions
effect the star's mass loss rate and the companion's accretion efficiency. Tidal dissipation,
involving equilibrium and dynamical tides, are necessary, where dissipation dependent on
boundary conditions which need further investigation in the context of substantial mass loss.
The interplay between AGB winds, pulsations, and tides indicates mutual induction of mass
loss and tidal dissipation, presenting a complex problem that requires further investigation.
